# HuggingFace -> Torch from scratch
This is a repo that contains the exercise where I manually transpose huggingface models to torch. At the end, we should be able to load the huggingface model directly into the pure torch model via `_utils.copy_weights`

## Usage
Simply copy the file containing the model `.py` file and it should work out of the box
